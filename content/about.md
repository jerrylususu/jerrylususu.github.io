## Who am I?

A(n)

- student / undergraduate / master
- developer (of some kind?)
- designer (to some extent?)
- anime lover
- ...

## What's my goal?

Nice question. Sadly, I don't know.

## Why `Nekonull`?

Neko, as everyone knows, stands for cat. Cat is great, but having one is not. Therefore, `nekonull` seems to be a great situation: expecting a cat, while not having one.
